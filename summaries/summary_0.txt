The world of Eryndor was in turmoil. People were disappearing and there were reports of strange creatures lurking in the shadows. The people turned to the bravest and most skilled adventurers to fight the darkness. Ruthuvikas, Gopal and Mahek were tasked with investigating a series of strange occurrences in the city of Aranthor. They discovered that the source of the trouble was an ancient cult that worshiped an evil god. The cult was trying to summon the god to the world, so the heroes had to stop them before it was too late. They traveled to the cult's lair, deep in the mountains, and fought their way through hordes of twisted creatures and traps. They defeated the priest and stopped the ritual. They had saved the city from destruction. The journey was far from over, as they heard rumors of even greater dangers lurking on the horizon. They knew that they had to stay vigilant and ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
