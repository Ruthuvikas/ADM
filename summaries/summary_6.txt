 The land of Eldor was once a peaceful realm, filled with flourishing forests, clear rivers, and majestic mountains. A powerful demon lord, known as Malakar, rose to power, and with his legions of undead minions, began a campaign of destruction and conquest. Three heroes emerged, each from different walks of life, but all driven by a desire to save their homeland. They discovered that the demon lord had a secret weapon, a powerful artifact that could only be found in the depths of a lost temple, hidden away for centuries.
