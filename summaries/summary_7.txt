Gwendolyn, Rorik and Moria were hired to investigate disappearances in a small village. The villagers had reported strange sightings and eerie sounds coming from a nearby cave. Many of the villagers had gone missing in recent weeks. The trio found a powerful magic user behind the disappearances, who was experimenting with ancient artifacts that had the power to bend minds and warp reality. They used their skills and spells to stop him, but they were outmatched by his minions. A group of dwarven warriors, led by Moria's cousin Drogan, came to help them. They destroyed the crystal that the mage had been using, including a powerful crystal that seemed to pulse with malevolent energy. The village celebrated the heroes' victory, throwing a feast in honor of them.
